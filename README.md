An exploration of protection against pass rush games

With NFL passing game ever evolving, effective pass protection has never been more important. Ensuring that the quarterback is given enough time to throw the football is critical in developing a winning offense. One way that defenses try to attack pass protections is by blitzing and sending 5 or more pass rushers. However, this does come at a cost as it creates larger windows in the pass coverage. Another way to manufacture pressure without compromising pass coverage is to run a stunt. Running stunts allows you to be sound in coverage while also dictating matchups and/or creating confusion in pass protection. For this study, we defined a stunt as an intentional exchange of pass rush lanes between two or more rushers aligned within 2 yards of the line of scrimmage. Additional tests, detailed below, were applied in order to ensure that the lane exchanges selected for this study match the traditional definition of a pass rush stunt.

After identifying stunts from Weeks 1-8 of the 2021 NFL season, our project attempts to distill the aspects of pass protection that are most pivotal in determining success. We begin by evaluating commonly held beliefs of how stunts are defeated by pass protectors. Three practices that offensive line coaches preach for defeating the twist are:

To be on the "same level" vertically in order to effectively pass off the rushers as they overlap,
Having "square shoulders" so that one is in a position to collect a penetrating or looping rusher, and
"Stopping the penetrator" close to the line of scrimmage so that the looper has a farther path to the QB.
Like many coaching philosophies, these arise from countless hours of film study, deliberate practice and demonstrated results. Here, tracking data and modern modeling techniques will allow us to not only determine how much each matters in defeating stunts but also bring to light other metrics not previously considered. We conclude by discussing how our findings and modeling generally can be applied in gameplan, practice and player evaluation settings.
